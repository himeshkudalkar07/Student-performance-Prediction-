# Student-performance-Prediction-

# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts student academic performance based on study hours, attendance, and previous scores using Python and a basic machine learning model. The objective is to understand how student habits affect academic outcomes and to build an easy-to-explain predictive system.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Analyze student performance data
- Train a machine learning model to predict pass/fail results
- Understand the impact of study habits on academic success
- Build a beginner-friendly ML project using Python

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| study_hours    | Daily study hours of the student |
| attendance     | Attendance percentage |
| previous_score | Score from previous exams |
| final_result   | Pass or Fail |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. Load the dataset
2. Perform data exploration
3. Convert categorical data into numerical format
4. Split dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate model accuracy
7. Predict student performance

---

## 📈 Model Used
**Logistic Regression** was used because:
- It is suitable for binary classification problems
- It is easy to interpret
- It performs well on small datasets

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Higher study hours increase chances of passing
- Better attendance improves academic performance
- Previous scores strongly influence final results
- Simple ML models can provide meaningful predictions
